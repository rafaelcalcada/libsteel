## About RVX HAL

**RVX HAL** is a **header-only C library** that provides a **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for RVX peripherals, including SPI, GPIO, and UART interfaces. It also offers a convenient API for interacting with the control and status registers in the RVX processor core.

RVX HAL lets developers access RVX peripherals and control/status registers in a consistent, high-level way, eliminating direct hardware register manipulation and making embedded code more portable, maintainable, and reliable.

### Key features
- **Header-only C library**: No separate compilation or linking required - just include the headers.  
- **Peripheral abstraction**: Simplifies access to SPI, GPIO, UART, and other RVX devices.  
- **Access to core registers**: Provides clean APIs for reading and writing RVX processor core registers.  
- **Lightweight and portable**: Designed for minimal footprint and easy integration into existing projects.
